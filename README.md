# Site Notes

Here are a few things to keep in mind as you edit and use the site.

## Skills Tags

The projects page is set to automatically add skills icons if certain tags are used. Here is a listing of the tag name and correct spellings to use:

* Photoshop
* Illustrator
* Indesign
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* PHP
* Google Analytics
* Social Media Marketing
* Git
* WooCommerce
* SEO
* SEM

## Future Improvements

* Add custom sidebar specifically for index pages to allow for filtering, etc.
* Create custom block type to add sections to projects plus applicable classes. More information on creating custom Gutenberg blocks [here](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/blocks/writing-your-first-block-type/).
* Create custom block that allows images to be nested within other blocks.
