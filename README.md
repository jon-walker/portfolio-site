# Site Notes

Here are a few things to keep in mind as you edit and use the site.

## Skills Tags

The projects page is set to automatically add skills icons if certain tags are used. Here is a listing of the tag name and correct spellings to use:

* Photoshop
* Illustrator
* Indesign
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* PHP
* Google Analytics
* Social Media Marketing
* Git
* WooCommerce
* SEO
* SEM

## Image Requirements

To keep a consistent look, certain images on the page should have the following aspect ratios:

* Blog Featured Images - 1:1 (Square)
* Project Featured Images - 1:1
* Project Section Images - 4:3 (Classic Video)
    * Add background (rgb: 2, 10, 16) to "empty" areas if different aspect is absolutely needed.

## Color Palette

* black = rgb(2,10,16)
* white = rgb(228,225,221)
* yellow accents = rgb(244,182,61)
* green - rgb(21,41,22)

## Future Improvements

* Add custom sidebar specifically for index pages to allow for filtering, etc.
* Create custom block type to add sections to projects plus applicable classes. More information on creating custom Gutenberg blocks [here](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/blocks/writing-your-first-block-type/).
* Create custom block that allows images to be nested within other blocks.
